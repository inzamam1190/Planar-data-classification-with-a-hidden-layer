# Planar-data-classification-with-a-hidden-layer
In this notebook we will generate red and blue points to form a flower. We will then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points. We will try different layers and see the results. In summary, we will:  

- Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.  
- Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.  
- Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.
